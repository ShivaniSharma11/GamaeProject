### Requirements

## Introduction
* This is a single player game.
* In which it contains enemies and a hero.
* The hero will kill the enemies using rockets that is bullets.
* He or she has to kill all the enemies so that they can't cross the border. 
* Hero has to shoot the rockets to the enemies to kill them. 
* When the bullet or rocket will touch the enemy they will vanish and others will come in sequence only.
* If you'll kill all enemies the you'll win the game.

## Research
* In this paper author has developed a model for COVID-19 detection using Chest X-ray images. Developed a model using DarkNet model using YOLO and achieved an accuracy of 98.08% for binary classification and 87.02% for multi-class classification.(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105581)

* In this paper author has developed a model for COVID19 classification using chest X-ray images. He took different images of  tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia , COVID-19 and normal. Used a model called DenseNet-161 and achieved  an accuracy of 98.9%.(doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.20136598)

* In this paper authors has used 5 pretrained models for covid detection using chest X-ray images of bacterial pneumonia, normal ,COVId-19 and ,viral pneumonia. They achieved the best accuracy on ResNet50 of 99.7%. (arXiv:2003.10849v3)

* In this paper they tried to detect COVID‐19 detection using chest x‐ ray images using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). The dataset contained images COVID-19, Viral pneumonia and Normal Chest X-ray Images.They used a Inception V3 with transfer learning for detection anc achieved an accuracy more than 98%(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088211)

* In this paper author has used different pre-trained models  ResNet19, denseNet-121, ResNet50 and SqueezNet for COVID19 detection using chest X-ray and CT scan images. In which they achieved the best accuracy of 97.5%.(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2020.105581)

* In this paper authors has developed multi model for COVID-19 diagnosis using  CT scan images and X-Ray images. They used two pretrained models ResNet-50 and VGG-16 for diagnosis and achieved 95.38% of accuracy in CT scan images and 98.97% of accuracy in X-Ray images.(doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103792)

## Cost and Features and Timeline

* This disease came into at the end of 2019 and still its all over the world. 
* This is basically affecting the lungs in severe cases and turning into viral pneumonia.
* People found a manual way in 2020 for its detection which was taking 2-3 days for detection.
* Then people tried to find more alternative and fast solutions then detection of COVID19 started by using CT Scan and XRay images.
* As CT Scan is costlier than X-Ray images so some people can afford only X-Rays.
* So we tried to diagnose using CT Scan images and X-Ray images. 
* Doctors then analyse those images and try to find whether a person is affected from COVID19 or not. 

* This project will save one step where doctors does't need to analyse that image. This will reduce the timing and also the cost too.
